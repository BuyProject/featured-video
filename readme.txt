Add Featured Videos to your posts and pages. Works like magic with most themes which use Featured Images. Supports your Local Videos, YouTube, Vimeo and Dailymotion.


== Description ==
*A picture is worth a thousand words. How many words is a video worth?*

This plugin enables you to define Featured Videos in addition to Featured Images. There are three ways to get the videos onto your page:

1. If your theme already makes use of Featured Images, these will __automatically__ be replaced by Featured Videos if available. Alternatively you can
2. insert the `[featured-video-plus]`-__Shortcode__ in your entries or
3. manually use the __PHP functions__ in your theme's source files.

Beside your __Local Videos__ (`mp4`, `webM` & `ogg/ogv`) you can use videos from __YouTube__ (w/[time-links](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=116618 "Link to a specific time in a video")), __Vimeo__ and __Dailymotion__. If you miss a certain video platform: [Leave me a note](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus).

The plugin adds some individualization options to your Media Settings. Beside aesthetic customizations you can turn off automatic integration and tweak settings regarding video sizing. By default videos dynamically fit their containers width.

= Shortcode =

	[featured-video-plus]
	[featured-video-plus width=300]

= PHP functions =
All parameters are optional. If no post_id is given the current post's id will be used.

	the_post_video(array(width, height))
	has_post_video(post_id)
	get_the_post_video(post_id, size(width, height))




*This plugin was created with the original [Featured Video](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/featured-video/) plugin in mind. __Featured Video Plus__ was freshly coded from ground up to bring you more features and to integrate more seamless into WordPress.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After adding the URL and saving the post I do not get any video? =
Maybe the plugin does not recognize the URL. Try the URL you get when clicking on share below a youtube video or the simple vimeo URL, which should look something like this: http://vimeo.com/32071937
If you want to you can post the URL which is not working in the support forums and the plugin might work with it in the next release.

= My theme uses Featured Images. Why are my videos not being displayed in place? =
For the videos to be automatically displayed you need to define a Featured Image. This image will never be shown if a video is available.
On the technical side your theme needs to feature [Post Thumbnails](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails) and make use of `get_the_post_thumbnail()` or `the_post_thumbnail()`, because there is where the plugin hooks into.

If the automatic integration does not work, you can tell me in the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus) which theme you are using and I will take a look at it and might be able to develop a workaround.

= How can I make the videos fit the theme? =
Take a look at your media settings and try fixed sizes. For most installations the automatic sizing works fine. If tweaking does not help: [Tell me](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus) which theme you are using.

= What is the easiest way to get my video into the supported local video formats? =
Take a look at the [Miro Video Converter](http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/). It is open source, lightweight and compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.

= What can I do about those errors I get when uploading my video? =
* Read [this](http://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-increase-the-maximum-file-upload-size-in-wordpress/) on how to increase maximum file upload size.
* WordPress by default does not support webM. The plugin activates it, but under some conditions this might not be enough and you might want to read this [post](http://ottopress.com/2011/howto-html5-video-that-works-almost-everywhere/).

= What happens if the user does not use a HTML5 compatible browser? =
The video player, [VIDEOJS](http://videojs.com/), features an Adobe Flash fallback if you provide an `mp4` video.

= What about other video portals? =
Leave me a note in the support forums which you would like and I will consider adding them in the next release.

= How can I translate the plugin? =
Grap the [featured-video-plus.pot](https://github.com/ahoereth/featured-video-plus/blob/master/lng/featured-video-plus.pot) file, [translate it](http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/) and post it in the [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/featured-video-plus). It will very likely be shipped with the next version.
